The project is about landing page that focus on the user experience and escpacially using the scrolling feature.

When the user click on one of the items in the navigation bar, it will automatically scoll to the correct section and highlight the item with yellow color underneath. I used addEvenLisener for both of them.

The last section is the "subscription" where the user can enter his name and email address and if the details are valid, he will get a message saying that we got his details. if the details are not valid, for example, his email address missing the "@" sign, it will send an alert message.
